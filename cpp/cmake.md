# CMake
CMake is the de facto standard build system for C++ projects.

Here are a collection of recommended links, guides and talks on how to use it.

## Getting Started
We recommend this guide to get started with CMake:

- [An Introduction to Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/)

Or alternatively these two videos from Jason Turner:

- [Intro to CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPMvU64RUTY)
- [The Ultimate CMake / C++ Quick Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbgH7yat-Jo&t=0s)

It can also be helpful to take a look at a simple example CMake project:

- [CLIUtils/modern-cmake/simple-project](https://gitlab.com/CLIUtils/modern-cmake/-/tree/master/examples/simple-project)
- [pabloariasal/modern-cmake-sample](https://github.com/pabloariasal/modern-cmake-sample)
- [ssciwr/cpp-project-template](https://github.com/ssciwr/cpp-project-template)

If you are starting a new project check out our C++ Project Cookiecutter:

## Official Documentation
The official CMake [documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) is a very useful and complete source of reference information,
for example if you want to look up the specific details of a particular command. It can also be a bit overwhelming, and
doesn't have many examples of how to actually do things, so it is probably not the best place to start learning how to use CMake.

## Best practices
For people already using CMake who would like to learn and apply modern CMake best practices to their C++ projects:
